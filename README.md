**Multi-Terrain-Robot-A-Hybrid-Ground-and-Aerial-Robot**

# **Project Objective:**

Developed a versatile robot, Multi-Terrain Robot, that seamlessly transitions between ground and aerial navigation. This dual-mode robot, controlled by a Raspberry Pi and Arduino setup, is designed for exploration in complex environments, making it ideal for tasks like remote monitoring, data collection, and terrain navigation.

# **Project Overview:**

The Multi-Terrain Robot combines the capabilities of wheeled ground mobility and aerial flight to create a highly adaptable robotic platform. It uses an integrated control system—Raspberry Pi for ground navigation and Arduino for aerial flight—allowing it to operate in various terrains and hard-to-reach locations. The robot can be operated remotely and autonomously, making it useful in both controlled and exploratory scenarios.

# **Key Contributions:**

- **Dual Mode Functionality:** Designed the Multi-Terrain Robot to operate on land and in the air, switching between modes seamlessly.
- **Modular Design:** The system integrates multiple sensors, motor drivers, and communication modules to support efficient navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Remote Operation:** Implemented wireless control using Bluetooth (for short-range) and RF communication (for long-range), enhancing user flexibility and control.
- **Efficient Power Management:** Developed a system to optimize battery usage, extending operational time during ground and aerial transitions.

# **Methodology:**

**1. Ground Mode Control:**

- Raspberry Pi 5 handles the robot’s ground navigation using precise motor control through an L298N motor driver.
- Sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers assist in maintaining stability and obstacle detection during ground movement.

**2. Aerial Mode Control:**

- The Arduino manages aerial movements and flight stability, receiving data from onboard IMU sensors for precise flight control.
- Remote commands for aerial navigation are transmitted using an FS-i6X controller.

**3. Dual Control System:**

- Integrated both control systems with a simple toggle mechanism, allowing the Multi-Terrain Robot to switch modes based on the operational environment.

**4. Power Optimization:**

- Used a high-capacity LiPo battery with a voltage checker and balanced charging to ensure the system operates reliably over long durations.

# **Challenges and Solutions:**

- **Power Management:** Switching between ground and aerial modes led to higher energy consumption. This was addressed by optimizing the power distribution and employing efficient charging strategies.
- **Seamless Mode Switching:** Fine-tuned the communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino to enable smooth and immediate transitions without lag.
- **Obstacle Navigation:** Implemented real-time data from MPU-6050 sensors to detect and respond to obstacles effectively.

# **Key Outcomes:**
